# NASA-Near-Earth-Object-NEO-Tracking-Insights-using-Public-API
This is a simple project that helps us track asteroids and comets that come close to Earth. It uses data from NASA's public API to show useful information about these space objects.

#What Does This Project Do?
Gets real data about asteroids that pass near Earth
Tells us their size, speed, and how close they came
Shows if they are dangerous or not
Lets you choose a date to see what was flying by on that day

#Tools Used
NASA API – free data from NASA
Python – to write the code
Requests – to get data from the internet
Pandas / Matplotlib (optional) – to show data in tables or charts

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nasa-neo-tracker.git
cd nasa-neo-tracker

#Why this is so cool
Learn how to use real space data
Practice working with APIs and Python
Understand what’s flying close to our planet
Great beginner project for science + coding lovers
